# id3v2_tagger
Script I use to tag my mp3 collection

This script adds id3v2 tags to mp3s organized in the following manner:
Artist/YEAR-ALBUM/TRACKNUMBER_TRACKNAME.mp3
i.e. (/Users/hubert/Music/) Radiohead/1995-The_Bends/01_Planet_Telex.mp3
It does NOT correct case.
My need to tag my mp3 collection came from realizing the iOS version of VLC does NOT let you simply browse directories
to play music. It organizes all your mp3s by "Album", "Artist" etc using the damn id3v2 tags. Untagged mp3s turn into
horrid mess. This is probably useful for iTunes as well.
